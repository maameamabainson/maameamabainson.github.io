I"H<p>This thesis revisited results from Shamarova and Pereira on fully coupled forwardâ€“backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) with jumps. I reproduced key proofs on existence and uniqueness, and explored their connections to classical solutions of nonlocal quasilinear parabolic partial differential equations.</p>
