I"¡<p>As a volunteer with the School of Mathematics, I participate in public engagement events designed to make mathematics more accessible and exciting. This includes developing and delivering interactive activities at local schools and public festivals, often aimed at young learners and families. Iâ€™m especially passionate about showing that math can be creative, relevant, and funâ€”no matter your background.</p>
