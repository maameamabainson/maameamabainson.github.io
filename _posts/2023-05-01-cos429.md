This thesis revisited results from Shamarova and Pereira on fully coupled forward–backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) with jumps. I reproduced key proofs on existence and uniqueness, and explored their connections to classical solutions of nonlocal quasilinear parabolic partial differential equations.
