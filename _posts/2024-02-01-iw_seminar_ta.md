As part of my PhD training, I serve as a course assistant, where I support undergraduate students primarily in Statistics and Mathematical Biology. My responsibilities include leading tutorial sessions, organizing lab exercises, and offering one-on-one academic support to help students deepen their conceptual understanding and develop their problem-solving skills.
