Working under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://researchportal.hw.ac.uk/en/persons/damian-clancy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Damian Clancy</a>, we study the persistence of endemic diseases by applying the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin (WKB) approximation to stochastic systems representing disease dynamics. By transforming the system into a Hamiltonian framework, we estimate the mean time until disease extinction, providing insights into eradication strategies in public health policy.
